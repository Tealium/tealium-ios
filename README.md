### What is Tag Managment ?

Tags are snippets of code that nearly every digital marketing vendor requires their customers to embed in the source code of their web sites and mobile applications.

A tag management system is a new type of application that makes it easy for digital marketers and IT professionals to deploy and manage these tags via an intuitive user interface with no coding required.

A key part of enterprise-class tag management systems is the [data layer](http://tealium.com/what-is-a-data-layer/), the behind-the-scenes data and structure that drive customer interactions in web, mobile, and other digital channels.

The Tealium iQ™ tag management system is a powerful and highly extensible solution that helps marketers easily manage their mission-critical technologies across web and mobile channels. Tealium iQ drives the complexity out of vendor tag deployments and is the cornerstone for achieving unified marketing, i.e., the ability to harmonize applications and data to drive superior cross-channel customer interactions.

### What is Audience Stream ?

The Tealium AudienceStream™ Influence DMP (data management platform) enables you to build a universal 360-degree customer profile to better influence and engage visitors in your web or mobile channels in real time. AudienceStream leverages the richest source of real-time, first-party data to help you deliver more relevant and timely interactions, thereby improving loyalty and conversions and creating new opportunities for growth.

### What is Data Access ?

The Tealium DataAccess™ solution is a rich set of customer data services and feeds delivered at the speed needed to fuel strong personalization and other timely customer interactions.
