 Abstract:
 This controller displays images, static and animated. It demonstrates using the image cache to send images from the WatchKit app extension bundle to be stored and used in the WatchKit app bundle. It also demonstrates how to use screenBounds to use the most appropriate sized image for the device at runtime. Finally, this controller demonstrates loading images from the WatchKit Extension bundle and from the WatchKit app bundle.
